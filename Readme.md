# COVID-19 India Data Analysis Project

This project explores and visualizes the impact of COVID-19 in India using Python data science libraries. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, geographic visualizations, and time-series forecasting.

## 📁 Files Used
- `covid_19_india.csv` – COVID-19 case data (state-wise and date-wise)
- `Indian Coordinates.xlsx` – State-wise latitude and longitude for map plotting
- `Covid19Project.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and visualizations

## 📊 Key Analyses
- State-wise distribution of **Active**, **Recovered**, and **Deceased** cases
- Time-series trend analysis of Confirmed, Recovered, and Death counts
- Interactive visualizations using `plotly`, `folium`, and `seaborn`
- Geographical heat maps of COVID-19 spread in India
- Forecasting confirmed cases using Facebook's Prophet model

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- `pandas`, `numpy` – Data manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Static visualizations
- `plotly` – Interactive charts
- `folium` – Map-based visualizations
- `prophet` – Time-series forecasting

## 🧠 Insights
- Maharashtra, Kerala, and Karnataka had the highest number of confirmed cases.
- Recovery rates improved significantly over time.
- The time-series model gives a forecast for upcoming confirmed cases based on historical data.
